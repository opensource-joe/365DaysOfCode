# 365DaysOfCode

This repo is a collection of my July 2022 to July 2023 efforts to learn more about data analytics, DevOps, and open source software OSS coding.

This idea is based on [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). Given I am an amateur endurance athlete with cycling and running, I decided to take go to the extreme with #365DaysOfCode. 

Here is more background of my time engineering Code.gov for the U.S. federal Government: A couple years ago while working as the front-end engineer of [Code.gov](https://code.gov/), I almost completed 365 days of code in an effort to increase my front-end engineering skills by doing "hands-on" technical work every day. In those days, I was focused on front-end engineering with HTML, CSS, and JScript primarily with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). I learned a lot about [accessibility](https://pa11y.org/) and [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) engineering with CI/CD and automated testing across multiple cloud environments.
